# Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics on MMDA Data
- **Descriptive Analytics** involved summarizing and describing the datasets provided using statistical measures
such as means, standard deviations, frequencies, and percentages. This analysis provided an overview of
the frequency of accident within a year, rush hour, holiday season, weekday season and different types of
time quadrants.
- **Diagnostic Analytics** focused on hypothesis testing to determine the significance of the relationships
between different features of time components and the distribution of accidents within the certain event
and places. Statistical tests such as ANOVA and Chi Squared Test were employed to examine whether there
were significant differences or associations between variables and likelihood of road accident.
- **Predictive Analytics** uses different best classification model analysis to explore the predictive power of the
feature importance on the Frequency of Accident in Metro Manila. Feature scoring models were employed
to identify which factors significantly influenced the frequency of accident.
- **Prescriptive Analytics** involved formulating recommendations based on the findings from the
predictive analytics.
